# Generative-Adversarial-Networks-to-Create-Fake-Images
In this project, I explore the whole concept of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), which are powerful neural networks capable of transforming images in multiple ways, such as converting night scenes to day scenes and generating real-like images of people who don't exist. Using the PyTorch framework, I will build and train a GAN model on the MNIST dataset, gaining hands-on experience in neural network construction and data handling. I aim to master the process of generating new, realistic images thorugh deeper understanding of Generators and Discriminators. This project not only enhances my skills in deep learning and image processing but also provides practical knowledge of implementing and training complex models using PyTorch.
